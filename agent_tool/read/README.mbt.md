# Read Tool

`read` returns text from a file at `arguments.path`. By default it returns whole
files when they fit within the output cap. For larger files, or when the agent
only needs a focused region, pass `start_line`, `max_lines`, or
`max_output_chars`.

When the agent needs several known independent files, prefer batching separate
single-file `read` tool calls in one assistant response. The tool accepts one
file per call so ranges, errors, and output budgets stay tied to a specific
file.

Do not use `read` for directories. Inspect directories with `ls` or `tree`, then
read specific files.

## Design Rationale

Every read has the **same shape** regardless of whether it is a whole-file read,
a line range, or a capped read: `<line-number>\t<content>` lines (the common
`cat -n` style used by other coding agents) followed by a single
`<system>...</system>` status footer. The optional range and output-cap
arguments exist for the failure mode seen in longer evaluations: large generated
files and dependency sources can flood the transcript and push useful context
out of the model window.

A uniform shape means the model never has to branch on "was this a full or a
partial read" — line numbers are always present (so it can cite `path:line`
afterward), and the footer always reports the range it saw (`start_line`,
`shown_lines`), the file's `total_lines` (so it can tell whether more lines
follow), and whether the budget cut the body (`truncated`). This matches the
lean, content-first convention used by Claude Code and the kimi agents, which
keep status metadata in a small footer rather than a verbose header.
Automatic output truncation is marked as a tool error even when the file was
read successfully; that makes lossy context visible to the loop instead of
silently pretending the returned prefix is complete.

For several known independent files, issue several independent `read` calls in
the same assistant response. That avoids extra model round trips while
preserving single-file ranges and independent output budgets.

## API Style

Use `path` alone when the file is known to be small or the full file is needed:

```json
{ "path": "agent/prompt.mbt" }
```

Use `start_line` and `max_lines` for generated files, logs, or dependency
source where the agent has already identified the relevant region:

```json
{ "path": "agent/prompt.mbt", "start_line": 40, "max_lines": 80 }
```

Use `max_output_chars` to protect the transcript when file size is uncertain.
The cap applies to the numbered body after line-number gutters are rendered (the
trailing footer is always appended). Prefer a range plus a cap over reading a
large file and relying on truncation.

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Required | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ----- |
| `path` | string | yes | Filesystem path. Relative paths resolve against the agent process's current working directory. |
| `start_line` | number | no | 1-based first line to return. Defaults to `1`. |
| `max_lines` | number | no | Maximum number of lines to return. |
| `max_output_chars` | number | no | Maximum rendered content size to return, counted in UTF-16 code units (`String::length`) and including line-number gutters when present. Defaults to `12000` and is capped at `50000`. Truncation snaps down to a character boundary, so a surrogate pair is never split. |

## Action

The action is always `Respond(ToolOutput(...))` — the agent loop forwards
`ToolOutput.content` to the model as a tool-call response. `is_error` is
`false` on success and `true` for read failures, argument failures, or automatic
output truncation. The string body has one of these shapes:

- On success: `<line-number>\t<content>` lines, then a newline, then the footer
  `<system>start_line=<n> shown_lines=<k> total_lines=<t> truncated=<bool></system>`.
  When the selected body is empty (the range starts past EOF, or the budget is
  zero) only the footer is returned. A zero-byte file returns just the footer
  with `total_lines=0 note=empty file`, rather than a phantom blank `1\t` line.
  `truncated=true` — set when `max_output_chars` cut the numbered body — is the
  one case that flips `is_error` to `true`.
- `"error reading <path>: <error>"` — a single-file read failed. Common
  causes: the file is missing, the agent doesn't have read permissions, or
  the bytes aren't valid UTF-8.
- `"error: read requires arguments.path"` — payload was an object but named no
  file.
- `"error: read requires object arguments"` — payload was not a JSON object.
