# OpenSeek Agent

This package contains the native-only agent loop for `bobzhang/openseek`. It
owns the system prompt, local tool schemas, native DeepSeek tool-call handling,
and dispatch for workspace operations.

The package depends on:

- `bobzhang/openseek/deepseek` for typed models, messages, roles, and tool
  definitions.
- `bobzhang/openseek/deepseek/client` for HTTP chat requests.
- `bobzhang/openseek/logger` for async stdout logging.
- `bobzhang/openseek/agent_tool` for tool registries, typed tool output, and
  loop-control actions.
- `moonbitlang/async/fs` and `moonbitlang/async/process` for local tool
  execution.

## API Shape

- `default_system_prompt()`: return the built-in generated prompt.
- `run(api_key, model, task, max_steps?, system_prompt_text?)`: run the agent
  loop for one natural-language task. `system_prompt_text` defaults to the
  built-in prompt so callers can run prompt experiments without rebuilding the
  package.

`run` creates a DeepSeek client, starts a conversation with a system prompt and
user task, sends native function tool definitions on each turn, executes any
returned tool calls, and sends `Respond(ToolOutput(...)).content` back with
`Tool(call.id)` messages. The loop stops when the model answers directly, a
tool returns `Control(Finish(...))` / `Control(Abort(...))`, or the step limit
is reached.

The agent client enables DeepSeek V4 thinking mode explicitly with
`thinking=enabled` and `reasoning_effort=max`. When DeepSeek returns
`reasoning_content` with tool calls, the agent preserves it in the assistant
tool-call message for the next request.

The system prompt source lives in `system_prompt.md`. During development,
`moon.pkg` uses the module-level `md_to_mbt_string` rule plus `dev_build` to
generate `generated_prompt.mbt`, which exposes it to the agent as a MoonBit
multiline string. The generated file is committed so downstream users can build
the package without running local pre-build commands. Other packages can reuse
the same rule with an input named after the generated function, e.g.
`input: "help_text.md"` generates `fn help_text() -> String`.

## Tools

The agent exposes eight local tools to DeepSeek:

- `shell`: runs `arguments.cmd` through `sh -c`, optionally in `arguments.cwd`,
  and returns exit code plus merged output.
- `read`: reads `arguments.path` as text.
- `edit`: replaces exact text in `arguments.path`.
- `write`: overwrites `arguments.path` with `arguments.content`.
- `moon_check`: runs `moon check --output-json` directly, optionally in
  `arguments.cwd`, and returns exit code plus merged output.
- `moon_cmd`: runs selected `moon` subcommands directly, optionally in
  `arguments.cwd`, and returns exit code plus merged output.
- `moon_ide`: runs read-only `moon ide` semantic navigation commands directly,
  optionally in `arguments.cwd`, and returns exit code plus capped output.
- `finish`: ends the task with `arguments.answer`.

Tool-call arguments are parsed from DeepSeek's raw JSON argument string and then
validated by the dispatcher before execution.

## Operational Notes

This package is intended for trusted local automation. The `shell` tool can run
arbitrary commands, while `edit` and `write` can modify files visible to the
process. Use the CLI package when invoking it as an application.

Run the package tests with:

```bash
moon test agent
```

## Real-World Run Notes

The DeepSeek V4-Pro TOML-parser trials showed useful cache behavior after the
stable prompt prefix, but also surfaced MoonBit-specific failure modes to keep
improving:

- The model needs concrete MoonBit examples, especially for package manifests,
  type aliases, mutable record fields, map construction, and error handling.
- The model repeatedly imported Rust habits. The prompt now calls out that
  MoonBit has no postfix `?` unwrapping for `Result`; generated code should
  match on `Ok`/`Err` or catch raising functions explicitly.
- Parser examples should include exact receiver annotations, string APIs, and
  unit syntax: `fn Parser::peek(self : Parser)`, `get_char`, `to_owned`, and
  `()` instead of `{}` for no-op branches.
- Long parser loops should avoid leaving `while` as the final expression of a
  function returning `Result`; put the final `Ok(...)`/`Err(...)` after the
  loop or return from explicit branches.
- The full-guide rerun improved API discovery and cache behavior, but still
  needed addendum guidance for native CLI imports, blackbox `Debug` tests,
  unqualified enum constructors under known types, and avoiding panicking
  `Map::at` when building nested tables.
- Long runs should be observable while they are running. The agent writes loop
  logs through `moonbitlang/async/stdio` instead of `println` so piped runs
  such as `2>&1 | tee run.log` receive step output promptly.
- Real workspace commands need a first-class working directory. The `shell`
  tool now accepts optional `cwd` to avoid repeated ad hoc `cd` command strings.
- The default step limit is 1000, and the CLI can override it with
  `--max-steps` or `OPENSEEK_MAX_STEPS`.
- Current MoonBit projects use `moon.mod`; `moon.mod.json` is legacy. New
  projects should create `moon.mod`, and manifest or package-import edits
  should be followed immediately by `moon_check` or `moon_cmd check`.
- MoonBit validation should prefer the `moon_check` tool over shell pipelines
  when the task only needs `moon check` feedback.
- Use `moon_cmd` for exact end-to-end MoonBit command validation, especially
  `moon test`, `moon run`, `moon info`, `moon fmt`, and README command checks.
- Before finishing user-facing CLI work, derive two or three acceptance probes
  from the task and run them with `moon_cmd run`. These probes should exercise
  real file arguments, stdin when promised, stdout shape, stderr cleanliness,
  and failure-mode output. This prompt guardrail is intentionally lightweight;
  future cram-style tests can encode the same probes as durable fixtures.
- `moon_cmd` requires `test_update_kind` and `test_update_reason` for
  `moon test --update`; run plain `moon test` first and only update snapshots
  after deciding the failure is not a behavior bug.
- Use `moon_ide doc` before unfamiliar MoonBit APIs and `moon_ide outline`,
  `peek_def`, or `find_references` before editing existing packages.
- MoonBit packages are flat like Go packages: files in the same package share a
  namespace, and file names do not create importable modules. Split generated
  code into small cohesive files for reviewability, but never refer to those
  files as modules.
