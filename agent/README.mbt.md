# OpenSeek Agent

This package contains the native-only agent loop for `bobzhang/openseek`. It
owns the system prompt, local tool schemas, native DeepSeek tool-call handling,
and dispatch for workspace operations.

The package depends on:

- `bobzhang/openseek/deepseek` for typed models, messages, roles, and tool
  definitions.
- `bobzhang/openseek/deepseek/client` for HTTP chat requests.
- `moonbitlang/async/fs` and `moonbitlang/async/process` for local tool
  execution.

## API Shape

- `run(api_key, model, task)`: run the agent loop for one natural-language task.

`run` creates a DeepSeek client, starts a conversation with a system prompt and
user task, sends native function tool definitions on each turn, executes any
returned tool calls, and sends tool results back with `Tool(call.id)` messages.
The loop stops when the model answers directly, calls the `finish` tool, or the
step limit is reached.

The agent client enables DeepSeek V4 thinking mode explicitly with
`thinking=enabled` and `reasoning_effort=max`. When DeepSeek returns
`reasoning_content` with tool calls, the agent preserves it in the assistant
tool-call message for the next request.

The system prompt embeds the handwritten `moonbit-agent-guide` skill content
verbatim before the user task, then appends a short OpenSeek-specific addendum
from real DeepSeek runs. This keeps MoonBit-specific syntax, package layout, and
validation rules in the cache-friendly prefix, which is useful because DeepSeek
has limited MoonBit knowledge compared with mainstream languages.

## Tools

The agent exposes four local tools to DeepSeek:

- `shell`: runs `arguments.cmd` through `sh -c`, optionally in `arguments.cwd`,
  and returns exit code plus merged output.
- `read`: reads `arguments.path` as text.
- `write`: overwrites `arguments.path` with `arguments.content`.
- `finish`: ends the task with `arguments.answer`.

Tool-call arguments are parsed from DeepSeek's raw JSON argument string and then
validated by the dispatcher before execution.

## Operational Notes

This package is intended for trusted local automation. The `shell` tool can run
arbitrary commands, and the `write` tool can overwrite files visible to the
process. Use the CLI package when invoking it as an application.

Run the package tests with:

```bash
moon test agent
```

## Real-World Run Notes

The DeepSeek V4-Pro TOML-parser trials showed useful cache behavior after the
stable prompt prefix, but also surfaced MoonBit-specific failure modes to keep
improving:

- The model needs concrete MoonBit examples, especially for package manifests,
  type aliases, mutable record fields, map construction, and error handling.
- The model repeatedly imported Rust habits. The prompt now calls out that
  MoonBit has no postfix `?` unwrapping for `Result`; generated code should
  match on `Ok`/`Err` or catch raising functions explicitly.
- Parser examples should include exact receiver annotations, string APIs, and
  unit syntax: `fn Parser::peek(self : Parser)`, `get_char`, `to_owned`, and
  `()` instead of `{}` for no-op branches.
- Long parser loops should avoid leaving `while` as the final expression of a
  function returning `Result`; put the final `Ok(...)`/`Err(...)` after the
  loop or return from explicit branches.
- The full-guide rerun improved API discovery and cache behavior, but still
  needed addendum guidance for native CLI imports, blackbox `Debug` tests,
  unqualified enum constructors under known types, and avoiding panicking
  `Map::at` when building nested tables.
- Long runs should be observable while they are running; buffered stdout makes
  stalled runs look silent until a large chunk of logs appears.
- Real workspace commands need a first-class working directory. The `shell`
  tool now accepts optional `cwd` to avoid repeated ad hoc `cd` command strings.
- Step limits should eventually be configurable from the CLI; real coding tasks
  can exceed a fixed small budget before validation succeeds.
