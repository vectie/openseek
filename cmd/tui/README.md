# bobzhang/openseek/cmd/tui

The OpenSeek terminal UI: a scrolling transcript with a live composer, built
on the reusable [`tui`](../../tui/README.md) controller package.

The TUI runs no agent code itself. It spawns the engine binary (`openseek`
from `PATH`; override with `--engine` or `OPENSEEK_ENGINE`) **once per
session** in `--serve` mode and drives it over stdin commands, rendering the
engine's JSONL event stream: streamed thinking and answer text move live on
the activity line, each turn's reasoning is kept as a dim `✻` transcript
aside above its answer, and tool results land as `⏺` blocks. Pressing Enter
while a task runs steers it mid-turn; Ctrl-C cancels the turn (a second
Ctrl-C kills the engine, and the next prompt respawns it on the same
session).

A custom or recorded-stream engine that only speaks the original
one-process-per-prompt protocol still works with `--engine-mode oneshot`
(env `OPENSEEK_ENGINE_MODE`); steering is unavailable there.

## Sessions

Every launch converses in a durable session — the engine only carries context
between prompts through the session store, so without one each prompt would be
an amnesiac one-shot. A generated id (`tui-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-mmm`, named in the
startup banner) stores the conversation under `--session-root` (default
`.openseek/`).

- `--continue` resumes the most recently active session.
- `--session <id>` resumes (or creates) a specific one; combining it with
  `--continue` is rejected.
- `openseek --session-list` (on the engine CLI) lists what is resumable.

## Configuration

`--api-key` (env `DEEPSEEK`) is required. `--model`, `--api-url`,
`--max-steps`, and `--thinking` mirror the engine's flags and are forwarded to
it through the environment, alongside the session settings.

The full flag reference lives in the executable help — verified verbatim in
[`tests/cram/tui.md`](../../tests/cram/tui.md).
