# bobzhang/openseek/cmd/tui

The OpenSeek terminal UI: a scrolling transcript with a live composer, built on
the reusable [`tui`](../../tui/README.md) controller package. It ships as a
library launched by the single `openseek` binary — it is the **default** mode
(bare `openseek`, `openseek "PROMPT"`) and the explicit `openseek tui`
subcommand. There is no separate `tui` executable.

The UI runs no agent code itself. It spawns the `openseek` engine — by default
this same binary, re-launched in `serve` mode (so the UI and engine can never
drift out of sync), resolved from `argv[0]` when invoked by path and otherwise
from `PATH`; override with `--engine` or `OPENSEEK_ENGINE` — **once per session**
and drives it over stdin commands, rendering the engine's JSONL event stream:
streamed thinking and answer text move live on the activity line, each turn's
reasoning is kept as a dim `✻` transcript aside above its answer, and tool
results land as `⏺` blocks. Pressing Enter while a task runs steers it mid-turn;
Ctrl-C cancels the turn (a second Ctrl-C kills the engine, and the next prompt
respawns it on the same session).

A custom or recorded-stream engine that only speaks the original
one-process-per-prompt protocol works with `--engine-mode oneshot` (env
`OPENSEEK_ENGINE_MODE`); it spawns `<engine> run -- <task>` per prompt, steering
is unavailable, and it requires an explicit `--engine` (re-launching this binary
in oneshot would only lose steering for no gain).

Because the UI takes over the terminal, launching it without a TTY (a pipe, CI
log, or cron) is refused with a pointer to `openseek run` / `openseek serve`.

## Sessions

Every launch converses in a durable session — the engine only carries context
between prompts through the session store, so without one each prompt would be
an amnesiac one-shot. A generated id (`tui-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-mmm`, named in the
startup banner) stores the conversation under `--session-root` (default
`.openseek/`).

- `--continue` resumes the most recently active session.
- `--session <id>` resumes (or creates) a specific one; combining it with
  `--continue` is rejected.
- `openseek sessions list` lists what is resumable.

## Configuration

`--api-key` (env `DEEPSEEK`) is required. `--model`, `--api-url`, `--max-steps`,
and `--thinking` mirror the engine's flags and are forwarded to it through the
environment, alongside the session settings.

The full flag reference lives in the executable help — verified verbatim in
[`tests/cram/tui.md`](../../tests/cram/tui.md).
