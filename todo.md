# OpenSeek Evaluation TODO

## DeepSeek V4 Pro TOML Parser Run

- Status: failed/incomplete as of 2026-05-22 11:17 CST.
- Task: use the OpenSeek agent with `deepseek-v4-pro` reasoning mode to create a MoonBit TOML parser plus CLI that dumps parsed TOML as JSON.
- Model setting: `DEEPSEEK_MODEL=deepseek-v4-pro`; OpenSeek defaults used reasoning mode with max reasoning effort.
- Log: `.moonagent/eval_runs/results/openseek_toml_cli_d4pro_reasoning.log`
- Log size: 2,283 lines / 99,169 bytes.
- Output workspace: `.moonagent/eval_runs/toml_cli_task`
- Result: the run stopped at step 60 with `=== max steps exhausted ===`.
- Validation: `moon check` in the generated workspace fails with 111 errors and 22 warnings.
- Missing deliverables: no CLI package, no README, no tests, no `moon info` output, and no passing `moon test`.

## DeepSeek V4 Pro TOML Parser Retry

- Status: stopped/incomplete as of 2026-05-22 12:35 CST after the run stalled at step 45.
- Task: same TOML parser plus JSON-dump CLI task, using `--max-steps 1000`.
- Log: `.moonagent/eval_runs/results/openseek_toml_cli_d4pro_reasoning_retry.log`
- Log size: 1,451 lines / 80,528 bytes.
- Output workspace: `.moonagent/eval_runs/toml_cli_task_retry`
- Result: log streaming worked; step output appeared immediately in `tee`.
- Progress: the retry scaffolded module, TOML package, and CLI package by step 2, then generated `types.mbt`, `scanner.mbt`, and `parser.mbt`.
- Validation: final manual `moon check` in the generated workspace fails with 59 errors and 12 warnings.
- Missing deliverables: no CLI source, no README, no tests, no `moon info` output, and no passing `moon test`.

## DeepSeek V4 Pro TOML Parser V3

- Status: succeeded as of 2026-05-22 15:16 CST.
- Task: same TOML parser plus JSON-dump CLI task, using `--max-steps 1000`.
- Log: `.moonagent/eval_runs/results/openseek_toml_cli_d4pro_reasoning_v3.log`
- Log size: 4,715 lines / 159,001 bytes.
- Output workspace: `.moonagent/eval_runs/toml_cli_task_v3`
- Result: the agent finished successfully at step 109 with parser package, native CLI package, README, public tests, whitebox tests, generated interface, and passing validation.
- Validation: independent `moon check` and `moon test` in the generated workspace passed with 32 tests.
- CLI smoke: `moon run --target native cmd/main -- /tmp/openseek-toml-v3-smoke.toml` produced `{"title":"Smoke","owner":{"name":"Moon","ports":[8000,8001]}}`.
- Performance improvement over earlier runs: the agent recovered from manifest and API mistakes, discovered current `Json` and async filesystem APIs before finalizing code, used `moon_check` repeatedly, and reached a clean parser package by the mid-run before adding CLI/tests/docs.
- Remaining issue: the README says `moon run cmd/main -- <file.toml>`, but the package is native-only and the module does not set `preferred_target = "native"`, so the documented command fails unless the user passes `--target native`.

## DeepSeek V4 Pro TOML Parser V4

- Status: succeeded as of 2026-05-22 19:49 CST after adding `moon_cmd`.
- Task: same TOML parser plus JSON-dump CLI task, using `--max-steps 1000`, with explicit instruction to use `moon_check` for compiler diagnostics and `moon_cmd` for tests, runs, info, fmt, and README command validation.
- Log: `.moonagent/eval_runs/results/openseek_toml_cli_d4pro_reasoning_v4.log`
- Log size: 6,477 lines / 277,636 bytes.
- Output workspace: `.moonagent/eval_runs/toml_cli_task_v4`
- Result: the agent finished successfully at step 135 with parser package, native CLI package, README, blackbox tests, whitebox tests, generated interface, and passing validation.
- Validation: independent `moon check` and `moon test` in the generated workspace passed with 22 tests.
- CLI smoke: `moon run --target native cmd/main -- test.toml` and stdin piping both produced valid JSON.
- `moon_cmd` impact: it caught real `moon test` failures, README doctest failures, native CLI compiler failures, and validated the final documented `moon run --target native` command. This directly fixed the V3 class of missed CLI-target mismatch.
- Remaining issue: the run took more steps and tokens than V3. The agent still wrote large parser files before the first meaningful check, read too much dependency source while discovering async APIs, and used `moon test --update` too freely.

## DeepSeek V4 Flash TOML Parser

- Status: failed/incomplete as of 2026-05-22 20:14 CST.
- Task: same TOML parser plus JSON-dump CLI task, using `--max-steps 1000`, `moon_check`, and `moon_cmd`.
- Model setting: `DEEPSEEK_MODEL=deepseek-v4-flash`.
- First attempt log: `.moonagent/eval_runs/results/openseek_toml_cli_d4flash_v1.log`
- First attempt size: 23 lines / 645 bytes.
- First attempt result: failed at step 1 by returning a JSON-like plan as assistant text instead of calling tools. No task files were created.
- Tool smoke log: `.moonagent/eval_runs/results/openseek_d4flash_tool_smoke.log`
- Tool smoke size: 9 lines / 270 bytes.
- Tool smoke result: succeeded; Flash called the shell tool for `pwd` and then finished, so the first attempt was prompt/tool-use sensitivity rather than complete tool inability.
- Second attempt log: `.moonagent/eval_runs/results/openseek_toml_cli_d4flash_v2.log`
- Second attempt size: 5,399 lines / 326,984 bytes.
- Output workspace: `.moonagent/eval_runs/toml_cli_task_flash_v2`
- Second attempt result: partially recovered, then failed. It reached a passing `moon check --output-json` at step 140 before writing tests, and a native CLI smoke run produced JSON for `key = "value"`. After it generated `toml_parser/toml_parser_test.mbt`, the workspace no longer checked.
- Final validation: independent `moon check --output-json` exits 255 with 117 errors and 48 warnings, dominated by invalid multiline string usage in tests. Independent `moon test --target native toml_parser` exits 1 with the same test syntax failures.
- Final run status: the transcript ends at step 147 with `OSError(@socket.Tcp::write(): Broken pipe)` after the failed test command; there is no `=== finished ===` success marker.
- Guardrail result: no `moon test --update` attempt was observed, so the snapshot-update guardrail did not trigger.
- Performance notes: Flash was fast enough to recover from the parser package's initial compile wall, but it relied on many one-off edits, got stuck on MoonBit syntax/API details for about 100 steps, and did not maintain validation after adding tests. It needs a stricter staged workflow before it is useful for this class of MoonBit task.

## DeepSeek V4 Pro JSON Schema Validator

- Status: partial success/incomplete as of 2026-05-22 21:10 CST.
- Task: create a more complex MoonBit JSON Schema validator library plus native CLI under `.moonagent/eval_runs/json_schema_validator_pro_v1`.
- Model setting: `DEEPSEEK_MODEL=deepseek-v4-pro`, `--max-steps 1000`.
- Log: `.moonagent/eval_runs/results/openseek_json_schema_d4pro_reasoning_v1.log`
- Log size: 73,791 lines / 3,389,910 bytes.
- Output workspace: `.moonagent/eval_runs/json_schema_validator_pro_v1`
- Result: the run stopped at step 103 with a DeepSeek context-length error after the CLI printed a huge generated C/native artifact into the transcript. There is no `=== finished ===` success marker.
- Library validation: independent `moon check`, `moon check --target native`, `moon test`, and `moon test --target native` all pass in the generated workspace. Final test count is 31/31 passing.
- CLI validation: independent `moon run --target native cmd/main -- fixtures/passing/schema1.json fixtures/passing/instance1.json` exits 0 but prints a debug dump of generated C/native output and then returns `{"valid":false,...}` with `Failed to parse schema: Invalid character '#' at line 1, column 0`. The CLI is not usable as delivered.
- Missing deliverables: no README, no generated `pkg.generated.mbti`, and no final `moon info` output were produced before the context failure.
- Performance notes: Pro recovered from a large 127-error validator compile wall, fixed public tests without using `moon test --update`, repaired a custom regex implementation based on failing tests, and got both default and native tests green. The main failures were poor file-read/API verification for the native CLI, leaving debug output in the CLI, and not bounding command output before feeding it back into the model.

## DeepSeek V4 Pro JSON Schema Validator V2 With `moon_ide`

- Status: partial success/incomplete as of 2026-05-22 23:05 CST.
- Task: repeat the JSON Schema validator library plus native CLI task after adding `moon_ide` and prompt guidance for flat MoonBit packages and small-file generation.
- Model setting: `DEEPSEEK_MODEL=deepseek-v4-pro`, `--max-steps 1000`.
- Log: `.moonagent/eval_runs/results/openseek_json_schema_d4pro_reasoning_v2_moon_ide.log`
- Log size: 72,627 lines / 3,191,156 bytes.
- Output workspace: `.moonagent/eval_runs/json_schema_validator_pro_v2_moon_ide`
- Result: the run stopped at step 80 with a DeepSeek context-length error after a debug CLI run printed generated native C into the transcript. There is no `=== finished ===` success marker.
- Library validation: independent `moon check --output-json`, `moon test`, and `moon test --target native` all pass in the generated workspace. Final test count is 37/37 passing.
- CLI validation: independent `moon run --target native cmd/main -- fixtures/passing/schema_string.json fixtures/passing/instance_string.json` exits 0 but returns `{"valid":false,... "Failed to parse schema: Invalid character '#' ...}`. The final CLI still treats `@env.args()[0]` as the schema path, which is the generated native C path in this environment.
- `moon_ide` impact: the agent did call `moon_ide doc @env.args` while diagnosing the CLI, and the prompt improved file organization compared with V1: it produced focused files such as `types.mbt`, `path_utils.mbt`, `regex.mbt`, `type_validator.mbt`, `object_validator.mbt`, and `combinators.mbt` instead of one monolith.
- Remaining gaps: the first `moon_ide` call failed because the target workspace did not exist yet; the agent copied too much from the prior V1 workspace before creating a clean design; the first library check still happened only after many files were written; and command output remained uncapped, allowing a single debug run to blow the model context again.

## DeepSeek V4 Pro JSON Schema Validator V3 With Output Caps

- Status: succeeded as of 2026-05-22 23:33 CST.
- Task: repeat the JSON Schema validator library plus native CLI task after adding command output caps and native CLI argument guidance.
- Model setting: `DEEPSEEK_MODEL=deepseek-v4-pro`, `--max-steps 1000`.
- Log: `.moonagent/eval_runs/results/openseek_json_schema_d4pro_reasoning_v3_output_caps.log`
- Log size: 3,200 lines / 179,082 bytes (196K on disk).
- Output workspace: `.moonagent/eval_runs/json_schema_validator_pro_v3_output_caps`
- Result: the agent finished successfully at step 99 with parser/validator library, native CLI package, fixtures, README, generated interface, and passing validation.
- Independent validation: `moon check --output-json .moonagent/eval_runs/json_schema_validator_pro_v3_output_caps` passed; default and native `moon test` both passed with 27 tests.
- CLI smoke: valid fixture produced `{"valid":true,"errors":[]}`; invalid fixture produced a structured `minimum` error at `/age`.
- Output-cap impact: the run did not hit a context-length error, did not inject generated native C into the transcript, and stayed two orders of magnitude smaller than the V1/V2 JSON Schema logs.
- `moon_ide` impact: the agent used docs and definitions for `Json`, async `fs`, `io.Data`, and `&Data::text`; after inspecting the real `Data` source it repaired the native CLI file-read path.
- Remaining gaps: the agent still waited until after a large schema file before its first meaningful check, spent many steps on MoonBit mutability and enum constructor mistakes, dumped full dependency/source ranges while diagnosing `Data`, and had a few brittle edit failures (`old_string not found`, missing edit path).

## DeepSeek V4 Pro JSON Schema Validator V4 With Bounded Read

- Status: partial success/incomplete as of 2026-05-23 14:22 CST.
- Task: repeat the JSON Schema validator library plus native CLI task after adding bounded `read` output for ranged and character-capped file inspection.
- Model setting: `DEEPSEEK_MODEL=deepseek-v4-pro`, `--max-steps 1000`.
- Log: `.moonagent/eval_runs/results/openseek_json_schema_d4pro_reasoning_v4_bounded_read.log`
- Log size: 3,345 lines / 303,726 bytes (328K on disk).
- Output workspace: `.moonagent/eval_runs/json_schema_validator_pro_v4_bounded_read`
- Result: the agent finished at step 180 with a parser/validator library, native CLI package, fixtures, tests, README, and generated interfaces.
- Independent validation: `moon check --output-json` passed; default and native `moon test` both passed with 21 tests.
- Inline CLI smoke: `moon run --target native cmd/main -- '{"type":"integer"}' '42'` printed `valid`; the string case printed `invalid` with an integer type error.
- Contract gap: the final CLI accepts inline JSON strings, not schema and instance file paths. `moon run --target native cmd/main -- fixtures/schema_string.json fixtures/valid_string.json` fails with `Error parsing schema JSON: Invalid character 'i' at line 1, column 1`, so the task is not fully delivered.
- Bounded-read impact: positive. The agent repeatedly used `read` with `start_line` and `max_lines` while repairing generated files, and those calls returned range metadata instead of flooding the transcript with whole files.
- Remaining output gaps: broad shell commands still produced noisy listings and large compiler command lines, and `moon_cmd` output caps do not control arbitrary shell output or file/source dumps.
- Guardrail gap: the agent bypassed the `moon_cmd` snapshot-update guardrail by using shell after `moon_cmd` rejected an unreviewed `moon test --update` attempt.
- Debug hygiene gap: the agent created temporary debug files/packages during diagnosis, including a root `debug_main.mbt` that broke compilation until removed, and it briefly overwrote the root `moon.pkg` with an empty file before repairing it.
- Best next ROI: enforce MoonBit command policy at the shell layer, add semantic CLI contract checks for file-path tools and JSON stdout predicates, and require scratch/debug code to live outside compiled packages.

## Agent Performance Improvements To Investigate

- Done: stream logs per step through async stdio instead of relying on buffered `println`. During this run the log stayed at 0 bytes for several minutes, then flushed in large chunks, which made live supervision difficult.
- Add a task checklist inside the agent loop and force early coverage of required deliverables: package scaffold, minimal parser, CLI, README, tests, then richer TOML features.
- Run `moon check` after each generated file or small batch. The first check happened after several large files existed, so the agent had to triage 141 errors at once.
- Prefer replacing or deleting stale files when attempting a rewrite. The agent created `lexer2.mbt` but left the original broken `lexer.mbt` in the same package, so both compiled and errors compounded.
- Strengthen MoonBit syntax guidance for generated code: current error propagation syntax, method declarations, enum derives for equality, labeled parameters, suberror constructors, range loops, string APIs, and `Char?` handling.
- Parse `moon check --output-json` diagnostics and group root causes before editing. The raw compiler output was too large and led to scattered one-off edits.
- Add step-budget guardrails. If the CLI and tests do not exist by a threshold such as step 25, the agent should switch from feature expansion to a minimal compiling slice.
- Encourage an initial spike with tiny executable examples for unfamiliar APIs before writing large parser files.
- When an evaluation allows local references, surface nearby working examples such as `.moonagent/toml_parser_demo*` before implementing from scratch.
- Do not hide validation failures behind successful shell exits. In the retry, one check-like command returned `exit=0` while printing compiler failures, which led the loop to continue from a false success signal.
- Keep module/package manifests and dependency assumptions under validation. The retry repeatedly mis-modeled `@json.Json`, `String::split`, suberror constructor labels, and `@string`/`@strconv` parsing APIs.
- Done: add `moon_cmd` for direct `moon test`, `moon run`, `moon info`, `moon fmt`, and `moon build` validation without shell status masking.
- Done: add native CLI ergonomics checks in agent policy. V4 validated README commands with `moon_cmd` and explicit `--target native`.
- Done: add a `moon_cmd` guardrail against using `moon test --update` without `test_update_kind` and `test_update_reason`.
- Done: add a read-only `moon_ide` tool for semantic `doc`, `outline`, `peek_def`, `hover`, and `find_references` queries.
- Done: add bounded `read` output with `start_line`, `max_lines`, and `max_output_chars`. In the JSON Schema V4 eval this kept generated-file inspections focused and prevented whole-file dumps during the repair loop.
- Reduce remaining token-heavy non-command outputs: apply similar caps or summaries to IDE source/definition dumps and broad shell listings.
- Teach the agent a staged validation invariant: after a package or test file is added, immediately rerun `moon check` before continuing, and treat a previously passing project as regressed until proven otherwise.
- Add prompt guidance for `#|...` multiline strings in MoonBit tests: bind them to local names or wrap them in parentheses before passing as function arguments.
- Done: add output caps/summarization for `moon_cmd` and shell-style command results. The JSON Schema V3 log stayed small enough to finish, where V1/V2 ended with context-length errors after native output flooded the transcript.
- Done: add prompt guidance for native CLI arguments. In current native `moon run`, `@env.args()[0]` can be the generated C/native path, so the CLI must drop the executable path before reading user files.
- Add shell-layer enforcement for MoonBit command policy. In V4 bounded-read, `moon_cmd` rejected unreviewed `moon test --update`, but the agent used shell to bypass the same guardrail.
- Add a CLI semantic validation helper that can assert stdout is valid JSON, that file-path arguments are actually consumed as files, and that output matches a small predicate, not only that `moon run` exits 0.
- Keep temporary debug code outside compiled packages, or provide a dedicated scratch package that cannot regress the deliverable package.
- Make `moon_ide` failures clearer when `cwd` does not exist, or teach the prompt to create the workspace before semantic IDE calls against it.
