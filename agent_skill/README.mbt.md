# agent_skill

Workspace skills: markdown playbooks the agent pulls into context on demand.

A skill is a markdown file under `.openseek/skills/` — either `<name>.md` or
`<name>/SKILL.md` for skills that ship companion files — with optional
frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: release
description: How to cut a release of this project.
---
1. Bump the version in moon.mod
2. ...
```

The engine discovers skills at startup and appends a `## Skills` section to
the system prompt listing each skill's name, description, and path, with the
instruction to `read` the file before doing matching work. The body stays
out of the prompt until the model decides it is relevant, so a large skill
library costs a few listing lines per request, not its full text. Missing
frontmatter falls back to the file stem and an empty description; a missing
directory is simply an empty library.

Two libraries feed the listing: the user-level (global) one under
`$HOME/.openseek/skills` (override with `--global-skills-dir` /
`OPENSEEK_GLOBAL_SKILLS_DIR`) and the workspace one under
`.openseek/skills`. `merge_skills` combines them with workspace skills
shadowing same-named global ones, so a project can specialize a shared
playbook without renaming it.
